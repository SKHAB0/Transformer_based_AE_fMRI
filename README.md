# Transformer based AutoEncoders on rs-fMRI data
This Msc. project constitute the main part of my thesis at Imperial College London (2022-2023). This project has been supervised by A. Luati. 

## Download the data

To download the data and unzip data for each phenomenon (e.g. DEPRESSION) execute the following command : 

```bash
bash download_depression_data.sh
```

```matlab
find DEPRESSION -type f -name "*.gz" -exec gunzip -f {} \;
```
